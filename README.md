GridField Gallery Theme
============================
SS3 GridField component that attempt to change the GridField layout into an basic gallery view. (Still in dev)

![preview](screenshots/GridFieldGalleryTheme_00.jpg)

## Requirements
* [SilverStripe Framework 3.1+](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework)

## About
* Display gridfield item as thumbnails for Image has_one relations
* Displays file type icons for File has_one relations (sample icons by [filetypeicons.com](http://filetypeicons.com))
* Action button accessible on mouseover
* Great with [GridFieldBulkEditingTools](https://github.com/colymba/GridFieldBulkEditingTools)
* Works with [SortableGridField](https://github.com/UndefinedOffset/SortableGridField)

## Usage
Add component like this:
````php
$config->addComponent(new GridFieldGalleryTheme('HasOneRelation'));
````
with the string 'HasOneRelation' being the name of the has_one Image/File relation in your DataObject that your want to use as thumbnail/icon preview.

### File type icons
File type icons are stored in the component's folder under img/icons/ saved as PNG and name with the extension of the file type (i.e. pdf.png)
Although, if no icon file is found for the specific extension, the extension is looked up in $fileTypeMapping to find a suitable icon.

## NOTES
* Tested in Chrome, Safari, FireFox, Opera and IE9
* GridFieldSortableHeader is hidden since this causes problem with the layout (at least for now)
